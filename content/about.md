Hello,  my name is Damilola Dolor, a web developer based in Lagos Nigeria and I love to build efficient server-side applications and APIs. I am currently in my final year studying computer engineering at the University of Lagos. I have a nice dog named Rigsby (after one of my favorite characters in the Mentalist) that I love to teach new tricks once in a while, I guess that's where my magical powers come from -- my ablilty to quickly pick up new tricks, skills etc. :metal:.
 In my spare time I love to watch football, make music and do a lot of other stuff I may never be good at.
I currently am open to entry-level opportunities to expand my skillset and improve myself. I am also into freelancing, so if you have need a web developer, you can [hit me up](/contact) or down.

Here is a list of some of the tools I regularly use:

* Golang
* Python with Django
* Javascript, Nodejs and React
* Version control (Git & Github)
* SQL (Postgres) and NoSQL (MongoDB).
* Linux

You can checkout some of my projects in my [portfolio](/projects).
