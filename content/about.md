Hello, my name is Damilola Dolor and I am a software developer based in Lagos Nigeria. I am currently not employed :sob: and open to opportunities both remote and on-site :joy:. Being self-taught for the most part, I have been able to gather skills required to build web applications some of which are listed my [portfolio](/projects). I mostly work with Javascript, Python and Go, and open to learning relevant skills, using the best tools to approach a problem. During my internship with [HNG](//internship.zuri.team) I contributed to the backend of the [Zuri chat](//zuri.chat) platform and ended up as a finalist in that program.

I am a final year student of the University of Lagos, pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer engineering, and although my grades do not reflect it, I love reading about computers and its history.

In my spare time I love to watch football highlights (I hardly ever have 90 minutes to spare except it's Champions league final), make music, engage in armchair philosophy and do a lot of other stuff I may never be good at.

I am also an introvert in the realworld and an extrovert in the metaverse.
