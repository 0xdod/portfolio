## Personal Projects
Here's a list of some projects I've been able to build while learning to code:

* [A mini forum](https://go-articlelate.herokuapp.com)
	+ A forum site where users can create posts, comment on a post, like posts etc. 
	+ This was built using Go and Gin framework, backed by MongoDB.
	+ [View source code](//github.com/0xdod/articlelate)
      
* [An image sharing platform](https://imagepload.herokuapp.com)
	+ An image sharing site, kind of like a lazy clone of imgur.
